The file `inventory` should contain the piblic IP address of the ec2 instance generated with terraform.
Update file before running.

The following files need to be updated with the correct domain name which you will be using:
 - playbook.yml
 - files/static_website.conf

Also update `index.html` so it looks cooler than what is there now ;)
 - files/static_website/index.html
